\section{Introduction}

% TODO:

%%Determine whether explainable/interpretable ML techniques like LIME and others can provide useful insights into the cause of the unfairness.

A model's accuracy is not always enough to state whether it will perform well in the wild because the accuracy highly depends on the data that was used to train and test the model. 
Explaining the results of a model, and identifying what leads to a particular classification can help provide insights into the model.
Once you add model interpretability, output can be easily understood by a domain expert and can be verified for correctness. This greatly enhances the trustworthiness of the model.


We are proposing to build a text classification model for a resume corpus and explain the results using LIME, and validate if LIME can provide stable and meaningful features. 

%% TODO: write your background and related work
%% Must contain:
%% - Background to make the proposal self-contained
%% - Short related work survey (what are the 3-4 most related papers about? what do they do?)
%% - Why is your proposal novel? What are you proposing to do different?

\section{Background and Related Work}

Model interpretation techniques have been in place for the last couple of years, but they are not always able to provide stable inferences for a given problem. 
Work done on inference healthcare model\cite{Rasheed2021}, Perturbing Inputs for Fragile Interpretations in Deep Natural Language Processing \cite{sinha2021perturbing} and many more have a common objective, i.e. to have robust interpretations for determining the trustworthiness of the model.

For our project, we are planning to decrypt the Job classification model on \href{https://github.com/florex/resume_corpus/blob/master/resumes_corpus.zip}{Resume corpus}. Our work will include categorizing resumes using CNN and RNN. We are going to train Neural Network and use the inference technique 'LIME'. 
%%Since the data contains technical words which are sometimes outside of the English vocabulary, we are going to tune word embedding for the problem domain.


Existing work has explored a CNN for training a classification model, as part of the project we will be using an CNN as well as RNN to learn the temporal features. The data contains technical words which are sometimes outside of the English vocabulary, we are going to tune pre-trained word embedding for the problem domain by utilizing the training dataset and other datasets from the same domain.

\section{Proposed Approach \& Plan}

% TODO:


%% TODO: Write a short timeline of your project
%%
%% - Describe steps and milestones for you project
%% - Briefly state what you hope the final outcome will be. (Will you have preliminary results to include on the presentation/poster?)
%%
%%
%% Keep in mind the project milestones must include mid semester report
%%

Following is the approach we are going to take:


1. Fetch data and take samples as per the distribution of data for train, test, and validation

2. Clean and vectorize the data for Neural Network (NN) approach

3. Build a NN architecture to learn classification labels

4. Train, test, and validate the neural network

5. Use LIME for model inferencing

6. Manually validate LIME output


For the test and experimentation, we are currently foreseeing that the local machine would be sufficient for carrying out the work. If needed we will use the hyper-gator resources that are availed to us as part of this project.
