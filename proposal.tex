\section{Introduction}

% TODO:

Determine whether explainable / interpretable ML techniques like LIME and others can provide useful insights into the cause of the unfairness.

A model's accuracy is not always enough to state weather it will perform well in the wild because the accuracy highly depends the data that was used to train and test the model. 
Explaining the results of a model, and identifying what lead to a particular classification can help provide insights into the model.
Once you add interpretability to the model, its result can be easily understood by a domain expert can be verified for correctness. This greatly enhances the trustworthiness of the model.


We are proposing to build a text classification model and explaining the results using LIME, and validate if LIME is able to provide stable and meaningful features.

\section{Background and Related Work}

Model interpratability techniques have been in place from the last couple of years, but they are not always able to provide stable inferences for a given problem. 
A couple of recent examples include the work done on inferencing medical...
TODO: add citation

Anther important piece of work was in categorizing resume using CNN and then finding inference using LIME
TODO: add citation




Since the data contains technical words which are sometimes outside of the english vocabulary, we are going to tune word embedding for the problem domain.

\section{Proposed Approach \& Plan}

% TODO:


%% TODO: Write a short timeline of your project
%%
%% - Describe steps and milestones for you project
%% - Briefly state what you hope the final outcome will be. (Will you have preliminary results to include on the presentation/poster?)
%%
%%
%% Keep in mind the project milestones must include mid semester report
%%

Following is the approach we are going to take:


1. Fetch data and take samples as per the distribution of data for train, test and validation

2. Clean and vectorize the data for Neural Network (NN) approach

3. Build a NN architecture to learn classification labels

4. Train, test and validate the neural network

5. Use LIME for model inferencing

6. Manually validate LIME output


For the test and experimentation we are currently foreseeing that the local machine would be sufficient for carrying out the work. If needed we will use the hyper-gator resources that are availed to us as part of this project.
